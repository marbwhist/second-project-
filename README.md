We are pulling from two CSV files to see if there is a correlation between the happiness of countries and their environmental variables. We will initially clean up the data in Jupyter notebooks to eliminate any unnecessary data before joining them in SQL. This joined data set will be used to query any visuals neccessary to illustrate our findings.
